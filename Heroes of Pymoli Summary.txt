Heroes of PymoliSummaryAlthough there are 576 players, there were 780 purchase made in Heroes of Pymoli.  There were purchase made by repeat players.The most active age range were players between the ages of 19-24.  Although this segmented group were the most active, they tend to spend less than other age brackets.  Males tend to spend more money than females, and tend to focus on higher dollar value items.  Although males spent more, they relatively spent the same amount of items per players.  On average the male and female players purchase at least 3 items.If I were marketing for this company, I would focus on woman players.  It would seem that they would purchase items for the game, if it were given at a cheap price.  In most games I would do a sales blitz for a 24 hour period to discount more desireable items, enticing more female users to purchase them, and being more powerful with spending less.  This should increase more female users to join the game.
